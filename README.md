## Description
<p align="justify">
Cardiovascular diseases represent one of the leading causes of death related to non- communicable diseases. One of the factors that significantly impact this number is the lack of engagement in activities related to prevention-focused on risk groups for the development of cardiovascular diseases, as well as the monitoring of the treatment cycle of patients with cardiovascular diseases already diagnosed. The effective use of exercise prescription for the rehabilitation of patients with cardiovascular diseases significantly improves the quality of life and reduces mortality rates. In this sense, the development of strategies to increase adherence and consequently, the time of physical activity of the population as a whole, as well as of those individuals with chronic diseases, becomes a fundamental goal for the population's health. Several recent technological advances, such as Internet of Things and network sensors, may represent an improvement in the monitoring and prescription of physical activity. Such technologies can be integrated to provide biofeedback on the prescribed physical activities, which can be accessed by smartphones. The general objective of the MAYA project is to develop and implement innovative, disruptive, safe, and low-cost technologies to increase adherence to prescribed physical activities and monitor the response of physiological variables, during physical activities for the prevention and rehabilitation of cardiovascular diseases. The MAYA project proposes to overcome this challenge through three integrated approaches:
</p>

* the use of applications with a gamification system to increase users' adherence;
* the use of a biofeedback system to monitor the prescribed physical activities;
* implant and test a prototype.
